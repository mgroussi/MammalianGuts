# MammalianGuts

This repository contains the data that we used for our study on the evolution of mammalian gut microbiomes, entitled "Unraveling the processes shaping mammalian gut microbiomes over evolutionary time", which is currently under review.

The data files are:
- alignment.33mammals.44444uniqueSeqs.fas: the multiple sequence alignment of the processed 16S data that we used for all phylogenetic analyses. 
- otuTable_44444uniqSeqs.txt: the OTU table of unique sequences
- tree.44444uniqueSeqs.rooted.calibrated: the calibrated bacterial phylogenetic tree used to run the BDTT analysis
- tree.44444uniqueSeqs.rooted: the non-calibrated bacterial phylogenetic tree used to run the BDTT analysis
- matrix_hostPhyloDistances.txt: the matrix of host phylogenetic distances
- matrix_dietDistances.txt: the matrix of host dietary distances
